### Robert's Martin Principles of OOD
Robert published his article "[The Principles of OOD](http://www.butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)" around 1994-1995.

#### Single Responsibility Principle
The article: [SRP](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByOwmqah_nuGNHEtcU5OekdDMkk)
> A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

#### Open Closed Principle
The article: [OCP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhCYaYDn8EgN2M5MTkwM2EtNWFkZC00ZTI3LWFjZTUtNTFhZGZiYmUzODc1/view)
> You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle
The article: [LSP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhCYaYDn8EgNzAzZjA5ZmItNjU3NS00MzQ5LTkwYjMtMDJhNDU5ZTM0MTlh/view)
> Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

#### Interface Segregation Principle
The article: [ISP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhCYaYDn8EgOTViYjJhYzMtMzYxMC00MzFjLWJjMzYtOGJiMDc5N2JkYmJi/view)
> Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle
The article: [DIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhCYaYDn8EgMjdlMWIzNGUtZTQ0NC00ZjQ5LTkwYzQtZjRhMDRlNTQ3ZGMz/view)
> Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
